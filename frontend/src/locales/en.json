Join us to explore the frontier of artificial intelligence!",
    "faq2Title": "There are two types of AI trend quantification robots",
    "faq2Content1": "Vitu Finance's AI trend quantification robot adopts a high-frequency grid quantification strategy, aiming to reduce risks while maximizing returns. It monitors hundreds of trading pairs on CEX and DEX, automatically optimizes trading strategies through deep learning and big data analysis, and achieves automatic profits.",
    "faq2Cex": "CEX-Robots",
    "faq2CexContent": "thereby obtaining benefits. Join us to explore the frontier of artificial intelligence!\nCEX-Robots is a robot that connects to centralized exchanges through API. Binance coinbase is a centralized exchange. After activating the robot, you can get stable income every day. The deposit for activating the robot will be returned to your account when it expires.",
    "faq2Dex": "DEX-Robots",
    "faq2DexContent": "DEX-Robots is a robot for decentralized exchanges. PancakeSwap Uniswap is a decentralized exchange. After activating the robot, you need to complete work every day. After the salary and deposit expire, they will be paid to your account together. The yield is higher than CEX-Robots.",
    "faq3Title": "How to quickly participate in Vitu Finance?",
    "faq3Step1": "1. Register a DAPP account through the platform invitation link in the crypto wallet browser",
    "faq3Step2": "2. Select the type of quantitative robot you want to participate in and start the robot",
    "faq3Step3": "3. Complete the trading orders of quantitative robots every day to earn arbitrage profits",
    "faq3Step4": "4. Promote team members to participate to obtain generous promotion rewards and team income",
    "faq4Title": "How to start the Vitu Finance robot to earn daily income?",
    "faq4Step1": "1. Select the type of robot you want on the \"Robot\" page, and then click the \"Start\" button",
    "faq4Step2": "2. On the \"My Robot\" page, click the \"Start Quantification\" button to complete today's arbitrage order",
    "faq4Step3": "3. Wait for tens of seconds to complete the quantitative task and get today's profit",
    "faq4Note1": "-Update the day's robot orders after 00:00 (UTC) every day, without waiting for 24 hours",
    "faq4Note2": "-You must manually click \"Start Quantification\" every day to complete the order task to get the day's quantitative income",
    "faq5Title": "Why do I need to pay a deposit to start a robot to work?",
    "faq5Content1": "Because we have signed effective quantitative orders with major exchanges and third-party institutions, we allocate orders to members who activate robots for daily arbitrage.",
    "faq5Content2": "If anyone participates in the work and quits without paying the deposit, or if the robot is activated but fails to create benefits, causing it to be abandoned, not only will our cost of building the robot be voided, but we will also pay a large amount of liquidated damages to other companies.",
    "faq6Title": "The robot can achieve 2%-3%/day income. Will production be reduced in the future?",
    "faq6Content1": "At present, the latest Vitu Finance robot's average income can reach 3%/day. Because our exclusive super quantum robot is continuously optimized, upgraded and iterated through the quantitative behavior generated by global users using Vitu Finance generative pre-training conversion, it has broken the monopoly on core technology.",
    "faq6Content2": "In fact, in the field of crypto, the quantified income of top companies can already increase the annualized income to dozens of times. However, because the technical threshold is too high and has an excessive impact on the local gap between rich and poor, it has never been made available to individual users or announced to the outside world.",
    "faq6Content3": "The birth of Vitu Finance is to break the industrial technology monopoly, so that all ordinary people can participate in quantification with one click through AI artificial intelligence and enjoy the early dividends of the industry.",
    "faq6Content4": "As the threshold of quantitative technology decreases and the industry becomes more common, the profit sources and risk-return rates of quantitative returns will decrease, and the benefits generated will naturally decrease. Revenue from newly launched robots may decline in the future."
